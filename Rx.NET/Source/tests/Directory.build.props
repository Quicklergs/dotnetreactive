    CA1822 - use static where possible. There can be performance reasons to do this, and sometimes
              there's an argument that it can better reflect intent, but a lot of test code has
              used instance members as a matter of convenience, and the amount of work to change
              that now that the code analyzer picks this up doesn't deliver commensurate benefits.
