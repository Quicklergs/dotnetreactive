    Diagnostics of limited value in test projects
    CA1822 - use static where possible. There can be performance reasons to do this, and sometimes
              there's an argument that it can better reflect intent, but a lot of test code has
              used instance members as a matter of convenience, and the amount of work to change
              that now that the code analyzer picks this up doesn't deliver commensurate benefits.
    CA1825 - use Array.Empty<T>. There is a performance benefit to this over using new T[0], but
              arguably a slight downgrade in readability. In test projects, although performance
              matters, the trade-off between readability and ultimate performance is different,
              so we don't want this rule.
